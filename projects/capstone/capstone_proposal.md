## Proposal
Cryptocurrency Price Indicator (Investment and Trading)

### Domain Background
Cryptocurrency (or digital currency) is a revolutionary concept enabling peer-to-peer currency exchange without relying on a central authority (like banks). Most cryptocurrencies use a decentralized/distributed ledger system, operating on the principles of cryptography, crowdsourcing and game theory. Satoshi Nakamoto first proposed these principles and defined the first blockchain database whose unit of currency is defined as bitcoin [1 - https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf]. The 

Bitcoin was created in 2009 and has mostly been limited to exploration by technological enthusiasts. The U.S. Treasury classified bitcoin as a convertible decentralized virtual currency in 2013 and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, classified bitcoin as a commodity in September 2015. Since then, it has garnered greater attention from general public and media. Mostly driven by speculative investments, it has seen an exponential rise in value in the last couple of years and several scholars expect the trend to continue, while others consider it to a bubble. Also, numerous other cryptocurrencies have been created as either variants of bitcoin or new platforms to support other applications. Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple are a few among the popular ones, also referred to as alt-coins.

Personally, I've been impressed with the technology for a while, but haven't made any investments. I would like to take this opportunity to understand the market (and technology) better and decide if it is a good time to invest in cryptocurrencies.

### Problem Statement

The objective is to predict the price of bitcoin and ethereum given historic data on these cryptocurrencies. Given the volatility in these markets, it is hard to arrive at useful models just based on price data [3 - https://dashee87.github.io/deep%20learning/python/predicting-cryptocurrency-prices-with-deep-learning/]. In this light, I would also like to explore the possibility of adding major associated events to this dataset such as regulatory acceptance (twitter or news feed), new feature additions (code changes) etc. 

### Datasets and Inputs
_(approx. 2-3 paragraphs)_

The historic price data on these cryptocurrencies (along with other alt-coins) is available on coinmarketcap.com. 

For the historic events on bitcoin, I would like to leverage the details on https://99bitcoins.com/price-chart-history/ and grade the nature of these events manually. (Time permitting) In addition, I plan to gather associated events based on newsfeed (from google news or twitter) 

### Solution Statement



In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, describe the solution thoroughly such that it is clear that the solution is quantifiable (the solution can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the solution can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the solution can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

### Benchmark Model
_(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, provide the details for a benchmark model or result that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the benchmark model or result contextualizes existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which could then be objectively compared to the solution. Describe how the benchmark model or result is measurable (can be measured by some metric and clearly observed) with thorough detail.

### Evaluation Metrics
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).

### Project Design
_(approx. 1 page)_

In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project.
